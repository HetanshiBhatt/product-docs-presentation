## System Architecture

Our new architecture focuses on scalability and security.

- **Micro-service routing** for efficient traffic management.
- **Enhanced authentication layer** with OAuth 2.0.
- **Real-time analytics dashboard**.

---

## Key Feature: Rate Limiting

- **Prevents API abuse** by limiting request frequency.
- Configurable thresholds for different user tiers.
- Protects downstream services from traffic spikes.

---

## Performance Metrics

The new routing algorithm has significantly improved request handling time.

**Algorithmic Complexity:**
Our new sorting algorithm for request prioritization operates at:

$$ O(n \log n) $$

This ensures efficient performance even under heavy load.
